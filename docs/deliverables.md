#Deliverables

This class involves weekly homework assignments in the form of coding exercises, some technical and theoretical readings, and discovery and research posts. Deliverables are listed at the end of the tutorial for each week and are due at the start of class the next week.

All homework assignments in this course will take the form of Markdown pages submitted as pull requests through Github. Our course repo is: https://github.com/tegacodes/Drawing-Seeing-Moving-with-Code/.

This class is also structured by a series of projects, their briefs will be posted here.

##Discovery and Research Posts
You are to write a series of Discovery and Research posts throughout the term on various topics related to the content of this course. You are to write at least 200 words on the topic including links to any artists, artworks, tools or references that you mention. To do these reports it is your job to browse and search through blogs, books, magazines, visit the library, look at websites, even go to galleries to find relevant materials.

These posts will familiarize you with contemporary work in media arts and design, deepening your understanding of ideas, issues and approaches of artists and designers working in these areas. See the [list of blogs and websites on the research page](https://github.com/tegacodes/Drawing-Seeing-Moving-with-Code/blob/gh-pages/docs/research.md) for starting points.

These posts should be written as markdown files and placed in your student folder. For details on how to use the github flavor of markdown, [see this guide.](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/). To add images, create an folder named 'images' in your student folder. Then add this line of html where ever you want the image to show up. ```<img src="images/theexactnameofyourimage.gif" width="600"></br>``` You may have guessed that you can set the width of your image in this way.

To add videos, embed your video as an iframe or link to the url. Please use conventional referencing to attribute research materials.
