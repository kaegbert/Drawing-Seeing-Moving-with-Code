# research/discovery week #1

Max is a visual programming environment used for sound and multimedia experiments and projects. It was created by Miller Puckette in the 1980's with the intention of creating interactive computer music. The program very similar to PureData, the open source programming environment also created by Puckette. PureData is designed for real time live collaboration via local area network or even across great distances and is open source. 

I became interested in Max after seeing some of David Bowen's work. "Cloud piano" is a project that uses a camera to monitor overhead cloud movement. The movement is recorded by a camera which communicates with a Max patch. Max communicates with motors that trigger piano keys based off of the camera input. "Fly Revolver" is a similar project where a video camera monitors movement of flies. The flies are "in control" of the movement of a revolver and will even fire it as a result of a Max patch.
